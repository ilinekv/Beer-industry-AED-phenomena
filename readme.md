Beer industry AED phenomena

Project timeline:

Made a business analytics project on the Beer industry unique phenomena of zero advertising elasticity of demand.
Analyzed several previous research papers along with the most current data from AB InBev to prove that industry advertising elasticity is close to zero, whereas brand advertising elasticity is significant.
To estimate the AED relationship, used Revenue as the dependent variable and Sales & Marketing expenses and Advertising expenses as independent variables in different settings and ran over 20 regression models. Time-lagged Sales & Marketing expenses and Advertising expenses and ran another set of models. Eliminated the inferior settings and concluded that AED of beer brands is not zero (1.0112), unlike the industry-wide AED, thus the brands like Budweiser still benefit from advertising.
Looked at Budweiser's sports sponsorship cases (FIFA World Cup, SuperBowl) which increase sales by single-digit percentages.
